#The following are possible answers to the challenges found at 
#https://github.com/dssg/hitchhikers-guide/tree/master/tech-tutorials/commandlinetools

#1. Create a final weather file that just has weather data from OHARE airport for days when it rained, and change PRCP to RAIN   
cat 2016.csv | grep USW00094846 | grep PRCP | sed s/PRCP/RAIN/ > 2016_ohare_rain.csv


#2. Create a separate file with just the weather from OHARE for days when the tempurature was above 70 degrees F.
cat 2016.csv | grep USW00094846 | csvgrep -c 4 -r "[7-9][0-9]|[0-9]{3}" > 2016_above70.csv


#3. Using crime data from 2016 (below), parse the json and convert it to a csv. 
#   Explore the fields and cut the dataset down to just day, location, and crime type. 
#   Then subset the dataset to just homicides and save as a new file.
curl -O https://data.cityofchicago.org/resource/6zsd-86xi.json    								# get data
jq . 6zsd-86xi.json | head -n50         				   							# inspect a little bit of json file to get an idea of structure
jq -r '. | map([.date, .latitude, .longitude, .primary_type] | join(", ")) | join("\n")' 6zsd-86xi.json > init_output.csv       # convert json to csv, and include just day, location, and crime type
cat init_output.csv | csvgrep -c 4 -m HOMICIDE > homicides.csv									# filter to only include HOMICIDEs

						   
#4. Use the lat and long coordinates of the weather stations to rapidly identify which weather station is closest to the DSSG building
#FIND DSSG coordinates via googlemaps.    41.8784754,-87.6292726
awk 'match($0," 41.87")==13 {print}' ghcnd-stations.txt | awk 'match($0,"-87.6")==23 {print}' > closest-station.txt
